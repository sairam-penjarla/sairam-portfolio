# **Module 3**

## 1. **Decorators**

Decorators are a powerful tool in Python that allows you to modify the behavior of a function or class. A decorator is essentially a function that takes another function as an argument and returns a new function that enhances or modifies the original functionâ€™s behavior.

### Defining a Simple Decorator

```python
def decorator_function(original_function):
    def wrapper_function():
        print("Wrapper executed before the function.")
        return original_function()
    return wrapper_function

def display():
    return "Display function executed!"

decorated_display = decorator_function(display)
print(decorated_display())  # Output: Wrapper executed before the function.
                           #         Display function executed!

```

### Using `@` Syntax for Decorators

The `@decorator_name` syntax is a more readable and concise way to apply decorators to functions.

```python
def decorator_function(original_function):
    def wrapper_function():
        print("Wrapper executed before the function.")
        return original_function()
    return wrapper_function

@decorator_function
def display():
    return "Display function executed!"

print(display())  # Output: Wrapper executed before the function.
                  #         Display function executed!

```

### Decorators with Arguments

Decorators can also accept arguments by using an additional nested function.

```python
def decorator_with_args(argument):
    def decorator_function(original_function):
        def wrapper_function(*args, **kwargs):
            print(f"Decorator argument: {argument}")
            return original_function(*args, **kwargs)
        return wrapper_function
    return decorator_function

@decorator_with_args("Test argument")
def display():
    return "Display function executed!"

print(display())  # Output: Decorator argument: Test argument
                  #         Display function executed!

```

---

## 2. **Generators**

Generators are a type of iterable, like lists, but instead of storing all values in memory, they generate values on the fly. You can create generators using functions with the `yield` keyword.

### Defining a Generator Function

```python
def count_up_to(limit):
    count = 1
    while count <= limit:
        yield count
        count += 1

counter = count_up_to(5)
for number in counter:
    print(number)

```

**Output**:

```
1
2
3
4
5

```

### The `yield` Keyword

The `yield` keyword returns a value from the generator function and suspends the functionâ€™s state. The next time the generatorâ€™s `__next__()` method is called, the function resumes from where it left off.

```python
def countdown(n):
    while n > 0:
        yield n
        n -= 1

counter = countdown(3)
print(next(counter))  # Output: 3
print(next(counter))  # Output: 2
print(next(counter))  # Output: 1

```

### Generator Expressions

You can also create generators using a shorthand syntax called a generator expression, similar to a list comprehension, but with parentheses instead of square brackets.

```python
gen = (x * x for x in range(1, 6))
for value in gen:
    print(value)

```

**Output**:

```
1
4
9
16
25

```

---

## 3. **File I/O (Input/Output)**

### Reading from a File

You can use the `open()` function to open a file and read its contents.

```python
# Open file in read mode
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)

```

The `with` statement ensures that the file is properly closed after it is no longer needed, even if an error occurs.

### Writing to a File

You can write to a file using the `write()` or `writelines()` methods.

```python
# Open file in write mode (will overwrite if file exists)
with open("example.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Hello, this is a test file.")

# Open file in append mode (will add to the file)
with open("example.txt", "a") as file:
    file.write("\\nThis is an appended line.")

```

### Reading Line by Line

To read a file line by line, use the `readlines()` method or a loop.

```python
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    lines = file.readlines()
    for line in lines:
        print(line.strip())  # `strip()` removes newline characters

```

---

## 4. **Regular Expressions (Regex)**

Regular expressions are used for pattern matching and text manipulation. Pythonâ€™s `re` module provides support for working with regular expressions.

### Searching for a Pattern

You can use the `re.search()` function to find a match for a pattern in a string.

```python
import re

pattern = r"hello"
text = "hello world"
match = re.search(pattern, text)

if match:
    print("Match found!")
else:
    print("No match found.")

```

### Matching Patterns

The `re.match()` function checks if the pattern matches from the beginning of the string.

```python
import re

pattern = r"hello"
text = "hello world"
match = re.match(pattern, text)

if match:
    print("Match found at the start!")
else:
    print("No match found at the start.")

```

### Substituting Text

You can use `re.sub()` to replace parts of the string that match the pattern.

```python
import re

text = "The sky is blue."
new_text = re.sub(r"blue", "green", text)
print(new_text)  # Output: The sky is green.

```

---

## 5. **Multithreading**

Multithreading is a way to run multiple tasks concurrently. Python provides the `threading` module to work with threads.

### Creating and Starting Threads

```python
import threading

def print_numbers():
    for i in range(1, 6):
        print(i)

thread = threading.Thread(target=print_numbers)
thread.start()
thread.join()  # Wait for the thread to finish

```

### Using `ThreadPoolExecutor`

`ThreadPoolExecutor` is an easier way to manage a pool of threads for concurrent execution.

```python
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor

def print_numbers():
    for i in range(1, 6):
        print(i)

with ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
    executor.submit(print_numbers)

```

---

## 6. **Context Managers**

Context managers are used to manage resources, such as files, database connections, or network connections, ensuring that they are properly cleaned up when done.

### Using `with` Statement

The `with` statement simplifies resource management by automatically handling setup and teardown operations.

```python
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)

```

### Custom Context Managers

You can create custom context managers using the `contextlib` module or by defining a class with `__enter__()` and `__exit__()` methods.

```python
class MyContextManager:
    def __enter__(self):
        print("Entering the context")
        return self

    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):
        print("Exiting the context")

with MyContextManager():
    print("Inside the context")

```

**Output**:

```
Entering the context
Inside the context
Exiting the context

```

## 7. **Testing in Python**

### Using `unittest`

The `unittest` module provides a framework for writing and running tests.

```python
import unittest

def add(x, y):
    return x + y

class TestAddition(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_add(self):
        self.assertEqual(add(2, 3), 5)
        self.assertEqual(add(-1, 1), 0)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()

```

### Using `pytest`

`pytest` is a popular testing framework in Python. It offers a simple syntax for writing test functions.

```python
# test_example.py
def add(x, y):
    return x + y

def test_add():
    assert add(2, 3) == 5
    assert add(-1, 1) == 0

# Run pytest in the terminal
# $ pytest test_example.py

```

---

## 8. **Concurrency: Asyncio**

Asyncio is a Python library used for writing concurrent code using asynchronous I/O operations. It is particularly useful for I/O-bound tasks like network requests, file I/O, or database queries.

### Basic Asyncio Example

```python
import asyncio

async def greet():
    print("Hello,")
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    print("World!")

async def main():
    await greet()

asyncio.run(main())

```

In the above example, the `async` keyword defines an asynchronous function, and `await` is used to pause execution until the asynchronous task completes.

### Running Multiple Tasks Concurrently

```python
async def task1():
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    print("Task 1 completed")

async def task2():
    await asyncio.sleep(2)
    print("Task 2 completed")

async def main():
    await asyncio.gather(task1(), task2())

asyncio.run(main())

```

---

## 9. **Memory Management and Garbage Collection**

Python uses automatic memory management and garbage collection to manage the allocation and deallocation of memory.

### Reference Counting

Python uses reference counting to keep track of how many references exist to an object. When an objectâ€™s reference count drops to zero, it is deallocated.

```python
import sys

x = [1, 2, 3]
print(sys.getrefcount(x))  # Output: Number of references to the object

```

### Garbage Collection

Python also has a garbage collector that detects and cleans up cyclic references, which cannot be handled by reference counting alone.

You can interact with the garbage collector using the `gc` module.

```python
import gc
gc.collect()  # Force garbage collection

```

---

## 10. **Metaclasses**

Metaclasses are classes of classes. They are used to control the creation and behavior of classes in Python.

### Defining a Simple Metaclass

```python
class MyMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        dct['class_name'] = name
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=MyMeta):
    pass

print(MyClass.class_name)  # Output: MyClass

```

In the above example, the metaclass `MyMeta` modifies the class creation by adding a `class_name` attribute to it.

### Metaclass for Singleton Pattern

```python
class SingletonMeta(type):
    _instances = {}

    def __call__(cls, *args, **kwargs):
        if cls not in cls._instances:
            instance = super().__call__(*args, **kwargs)
            cls._instances[cls] = instance
        return cls._instances[cls]

class SingletonClass(metaclass=SingletonMeta):
    pass

obj1 = SingletonClass()
obj2 = SingletonClass()
print(obj1 is obj2)  # Output: True

```

---

## 11. **Profiling and Optimization**

Profiling helps you understand the performance bottlenecks in your code, and optimization allows you to improve the performance.

### Using `cProfile` for Profiling

You can use the `cProfile` module to profile your Python programs.

```python
import cProfile

def slow_function():
    for _ in range(1000000):
        pass

cProfile.run('slow_function()')

```

This will output profiling data, showing the time spent in different parts of your code.

### Using `timeit` for Microbenchmarking

You can use the `timeit` module to measure the execution time of small code snippets.

```python
import timeit

print(timeit.timeit('x = [i for i in range(1000)]', number=1000))  # Time to run the code 1000 times

```

---

## 12. **Unit Testing**

Unit testing is a crucial part of ensuring your code works as expected. Python provides the `unittest` framework to write and run tests for your functions and classes.

### Writing Unit Tests

```python
import unittest

def add(x, y):
    return x + y

class TestMathOperations(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_add(self):
        self.assertEqual(add(2, 3), 5)
        self.assertEqual(add(-1, 1), 0)
        self.assertEqual(add(0, 0), 0)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()

```

In the above code, the `TestMathOperations` class inherits from `unittest.TestCase`. The `test_add` method is a unit test that checks if the `add` function works correctly.

### Running Tests

You can run the tests from the command line using:

```bash
python -m unittest test_module.py

```

---

Python offers both threading and multiprocessing for concurrent execution of tasks.

### Threading

Threading is used to run tasks concurrently in the same process. It is suitable for I/O-bound tasks.

```python
import threading

def print_numbers():
    for i in range(5):
        print(i)

thread = threading.Thread(target=print_numbers)
thread.start()
thread.join()  # Wait for the thread to finish

```

## 13. Multiprocessing

Multiprocessing is used for CPU-bound tasks and allows running tasks in separate processes, utilizing multiple CPU cores.

```python
import multiprocessing

def square_number(n):
    return n * n

if __name__ == '__main__':
    with multiprocessing.Pool() as pool:
        results = pool.map(square_number, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
    print(results)  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]

```

`multiprocessing.Pool` is used to parallelize tasks across multiple processes.

## 14. **Serialization with `pickle`**

Serialization allows you to save Python objects to files and load them back later. The `pickle` module provides a way to serialize and deserialize Python objects.

### Pickling and Unpickling Objects

```python
import pickle

# Pickling
data = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25}
with open('data.pickle', 'wb') as f:
    pickle.dump(data, f)

# Unpickling
with open('data.pickle', 'rb') as f:
    loaded_data = pickle.load(f)
print(loaded_data)  # Output: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25}

```

Pickle allows storing and retrieving complex objects like dictionaries, lists, and custom classes.

---

## 15. **Logging**

The `logging` module in Python is used for logging messages from your code, which can help with debugging and monitoring.

### Basic Logging

```python
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
logging.debug("This is a debug message")
logging.info("This is an info message")
logging.warning("This is a warning message")
logging.error("This is an error message")
logging.critical("This is a critical message")

```

You can configure the logging level to filter messages based on severity (`DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `CRITICAL`).

---

## 16. **Command-Line Arguments**

Python allows you to pass arguments to your script using the `sys.argv` list or the `argparse` module.

### Using `sys.argv`

```python
import sys

print(f"Script name: {sys.argv[0]}")
for i in range(1, len(sys.argv)):
    print(f"Argument {i}: {sys.argv[i]}")

```

Running the script with arguments:

```bash
python myscript.py arg1 arg2

```

### Using `argparse`

```python
import argparse

parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description="My Script")
parser.add_argument('name', help='Your name')
parser.add_argument('age', type=int, help='Your age')
args = parser.parse_args()

print(f"Hello, {args.name}! You are {args.age} years old.")

```

You can pass arguments to the script like:

```bash
python myscript.py Alice 30

```

---
