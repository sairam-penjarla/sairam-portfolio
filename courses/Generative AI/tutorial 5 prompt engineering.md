## Clarity, Context, and Constraints

When crafting prompts, providing clear instructions, sufficient context, and specific constraints can dramatically improve results.

```plaintext
## Task  
Summarize the impact of artificial intelligence on the job market.  

## Guidelines  
- Provide a balanced perspective with both positive and negative impacts.  
- Keep the summary under 150 words.  
- Use simple language, suitable for a general audience.  

## Instructions  
- Start with a brief introduction (1–2 sentences).  
- Highlight key areas where AI is transforming jobs.  
- Mention any emerging trends, such as AI-assisted work.  
- Avoid technical jargon; keep it accessible.  

## Output Format  
- A single paragraph under 150 words.  
```

**Key takeaways:**
- Break your prompt into clear sections
- Provide specific guidelines on tone, length, and complexity
- Give step-by-step instructions for structure
- Specify the desired output format

## Zero-Shot Prompting

Zero-shot prompting involves asking a model to perform a task without providing any examples.

```plaintext
## Task  
Explain the concept of Reinforcement Learning.  

## Guidelines  
- Assume the reader has no prior knowledge of AI.  
- Keep the explanation concise but informative.  

## Instructions  
- Define Reinforcement Learning in simple terms.  
- Provide a real-world analogy to help understanding.  
- Avoid excessive technical details.  

## Output Format  
- A short paragraph (50–100 words).  
```

**Key takeaways:**
- Clearly state what you want explained
- Set expectations for knowledge level and complexity
- Request specific elements (definition, analogy)
- Specify format and length

## Few-Shot Prompting

Few-shot prompting provides the model with examples to establish a pattern before asking it to complete a similar task.

```plaintext
## Task  
Convert active voice sentences into passive voice.  

## Guidelines  
- Follow the structure of the given examples.  
- Ensure grammatical correctness.  

## Instructions  
Example 1:  
**Input:** (Active) The chef cooked a delicious meal.  
**Output:** (Passive) A delicious meal was cooked by the chef.  

Example 2:  
**Input:** (Active) She wrote a novel.  
**Output:** (Passive) A novel was written by her.  

Now, convert this:  
**Input:** (Active) The team won the championship.  

## Output Format  
- A single sentence in passive voice.  
```

**Key takeaways:**
- Provide 2-3 clear examples that demonstrate the pattern
- Use consistent formatting for inputs and outputs
- Make examples diverse enough to show pattern variations
- Clearly mark where the model should apply the pattern

## Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting

Chain-of-Thought prompting encourages the model to break down complex reasoning tasks into intermediate steps.

```plaintext
## Task  
Solve this math problem step by step.  

## Guidelines  
- Show each step clearly.  
- Explain the logic behind each calculation.  

## Instructions  
A factory produces 250 items per day. If production increases by 15% next month, how many items will be produced per day?  

## Output Format  
- Step 1: Identify the current production.  
- Step 2: Calculate the 15% increase.  
- Step 3: Compute the new production value.  
- Step 4: Provide the final answer.  
```

**Key takeaways:**
- Explicitly request step-by-step reasoning
- Break down the expected steps in advance
- Ask for explanations, not just calculations
- Provide a clear structure for the response

## Role-Based Prompting

Role-based prompting assigns a specific persona to the AI, which can help tailor responses to specific domains or expertise levels.

```plaintext
## Task  
Explain the concept of blockchain as a finance expert.  

## Guidelines  
- Use terminology that financial professionals would understand.  
- Relate blockchain to financial applications like payments and investments.  

## Instructions  
- Define blockchain in one sentence.  
- Explain how it impacts finance, particularly in security and transparency.  
- Use real-world examples such as cryptocurrency transactions.  

## Output Format  
- A well-structured response in 3 paragraphs.  
```

**Key takeaways:**
- Clearly define the role/persona you want the AI to adopt
- Specify the expertise level and terminology expectations
- Request domain-specific examples and applications
- Structure the response to match professional standards

## Negative Prompting

Negative prompting explicitly states what to avoid, helping steer the model away from common pitfalls or biases.

```plaintext
## Task  
Summarize the effects of climate change.  

## Guidelines  
- Do NOT include opinions or predictions.  
- Avoid alarmist or exaggerated language.  

## Instructions  
- Stick to factual, scientifically proven impacts.  
- Cover key areas like temperature rise, sea level changes, and extreme weather.  
- Keep the language neutral and objective.  

## Output Format  
- A structured summary in 100–150 words.  
```

**Key takeaways:**
- Explicitly state what should NOT be included
- Highlight specific types of language or content to avoid
- Provide clear alternatives for what should be included instead
- Set boundaries on opinion, speculation, or bias

## Formatting Output for Structured Responses

When you need data in a specific format (like JSON), provide clear instructions and examples of the desired structure.

```plaintext
## Task  
Extract key details from the following text and return them in JSON format.  

## Guidelines  
- Identify the person's name, age, profession, and company.  
- Ensure the JSON structure follows the given format.  

## Instructions  
Text: "John, a 28-year-old software engineer, works at Google."  

## Output Format  
```json
{
  "name": "John",
  "age": 28,
  "profession": "Software Engineer",
  "company": "Google"
}```
```

**Key takeaways:**
- Specify the exact format (JSON, CSV, etc.)
- Provide a template with the required fields
- Use proper syntax in your examples
- Specify types (strings, integers) when important

## Conclusion

Effective prompt engineering is both an art and a science. These techniques can be combined and adapted to suit your specific needs. When designing prompts:

1. **Be explicit**: Clearly state what you want the model to do
2. **Provide structure**: Break complex tasks into steps
3. **Set constraints**: Define boundaries for length, style, and content
4. **Show examples**: Demonstrate the pattern you want followed
5. **Test and iterate**: Refine your prompts based on results

By mastering these prompt engineering techniques, you'll be able to get more accurate, useful, and appropriate responses from large language models.
