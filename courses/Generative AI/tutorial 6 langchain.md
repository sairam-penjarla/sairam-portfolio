## **Module 1: Introduction to LangChain**

### **1.1 What is LangChain?**

LangChain is a framework that helps developers create applications powered by large language models (LLMs). It integrates with LLMs and tools such as APIs, databases, and file systems, making it easier to build advanced applications like chatbots, research assistants, and more.

LangChain provides the following key features:

- **Modular design**: Reusable components that simplify building complex applications.
- **Tool Integration**: Supports interacting with APIs, databases, and web scraping tools.
- **Memory**: Capabilities for long-term and short-term memory, allowing agents to remember past interactions.

### **1.2 Installing LangChain**

To get started with LangChain, you first need to install it. Open your terminal and run:

```bash
pip install langchain

```

This will install the latest version of LangChain and its dependencies.

## **Module 2: Getting Started with LangChain**

### **2.1 Basic LangChain Setup**

Now that LangChain is installed, let’s start by writing a simple LangChain script. We’ll use an OpenAI LLM to create a basic chatbot.

Here’s how you can set up a simple LangChain agent:

```python
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.chains import LLMChain
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate

# Create a prompt template
template = "Hello, I am an AI assistant. How can I help you today?"
prompt = PromptTemplate(input_variables=[], template=template)

# Initialize the LLM model
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0.7)

# Create the chain
chain = LLMChain(prompt=prompt, llm=llm)

# Get a response from the chain
response = chain.run()
print(response)

```

### **2.2 Code Explanation:**

- **PromptTemplate**: We define a simple template for the model's response.
- **OpenAI(temperature=0.7)**: We use OpenAI’s LLM with a temperature setting that controls the randomness of the response.
- **LLMChain**: The `LLMChain` connects the prompt and the LLM together, allowing you to process the input and generate a response.

**Expected Output:**

```
Hello, I am an AI assistant. How can I help you today?

```

## **Module 3: Working with LangChain Tools**

### **3.1 What are LangChain Tools?**

LangChain provides various tools that help you interact with external data sources and perform more complex tasks. These tools can include:

- APIs
- Web scraping tools
- Databases
- External libraries

In this section, we’ll integrate a simple external tool — the Wikipedia API.

### **3.2 Integrating Wikipedia API**

```python
from langchain.tools import Tool
import requests

# Define the Wikipedia tool
def fetch_wikipedia(query):
    url = f"<https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=query&format=json&list=search&srsearch={query}>"
    response = requests.get(url).json()
    return response['query']['search'][0]['snippet']

# Create a tool for LangChain
wikipedia_tool = Tool(name="Wikipedia", func=fetch_wikipedia, description="Search Wikipedia for information")

# Use the tool
query = "LangChain"
response = wikipedia_tool.run(query)
print(response)

```

### **3.3 Code Explanation:**

- **Wikipedia API**: We define a simple function that makes an API request to Wikipedia and fetches a snippet of information based on a search query.
- **Tool**: The `Tool` object is created to integrate this function into LangChain. It allows the LangChain agent to call this tool whenever necessary.

**Expected Output:**

```
LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models.

```

## **Module 4: Memory in LangChain**

### **4.1 Introduction to Memory**

Memory allows LangChain agents to remember past interactions and use this information in future tasks. There are two types of memory:

- **Short-term memory**: Stores recent interactions.
- **Long-term memory**: Stores past information for use in future sessions.

### **4.2 Implementing Short-Term Memory**

LangChain provides built-in memory classes to handle this. Let’s set up short-term memory for an agent.

```python
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory

# Initialize memory
memory = ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key="chat_history", return_messages=True)

# Define the agent with memory
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0.7)
tools = [wikipedia_tool]
agent = initialize_agent(tools, llm, agent_type=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, memory=memory)

# First interaction
response1 = agent.run("What is LangChain?")
print(response1)

# Second interaction
response2 = agent.run("Tell me more about LangChain.")
print(response2)

```

### **4.3 Code Explanation:**

- **ConversationBufferMemory**: This class stores the conversation history and allows the agent to refer back to it.
- **Memory in Agent**: By passing the `memory` object to the agent, it can maintain context over multiple interactions.

**Expected Output:**

```
Response 1: LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models.
Response 2: LangChain helps integrate external tools like APIs, databases, and web scraping into LLM applications.

```

## **Module 5: Advanced Prompts and Templates**

### **5.1 Using Dynamic Prompts**

LangChain allows you to use dynamic prompts, where the prompt template can change based on the input. This is helpful when you need flexibility in your model responses.

### **5.2 Example of Dynamic Prompts**

```python
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
from langchain.chains import LLMChain

# Dynamic prompt based on user input
user_input = "Explain the role of AI in healthcare"
template = "Please provide an overview of {user_input}"
prompt = PromptTemplate(input_variables=["user_input"], template=template)

# Initialize the LLM
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0.7)

# Create the chain with the dynamic prompt
chain = LLMChain(prompt=prompt, llm=llm)

# Get the response
response = chain.run(user_input=user_input)
print(response)

```

### **5.3 Code Explanation:**

- **Dynamic Template**: The template includes a placeholder `{user_input}` which is replaced by the actual input provided by the user.
- **LLMChain**: The `LLMChain` is used to link the dynamic prompt with the LLM.

**Expected Output:**

```
AI in healthcare is crucial for enhancing diagnostic accuracy, personalizing treatment plans, and improving patient outcomes.

```

## **Module 6: Chain-of-Thought Reasoning**

### **6.1 What is Chain-of-Thought?**

Chain-of-thought reasoning allows LangChain agents to reason step-by-step through complex problems, breaking them into smaller sub-tasks. This helps the agent make better decisions in a logical sequence.

### **6.2 Example of Chain-of-Thought Reasoning**

```python
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
from langchain.chains import LLMChain

# Chain-of-thought prompt for reasoning
template = """
Let's solve this step by step:
1. Identify the problem.
2. Break it down into smaller tasks.
3. Find a solution to each task.
"""
prompt = PromptTemplate(input_variables=[], template=template)

# Initialize the LLM
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0.7)

# Create the chain
chain = LLMChain(prompt=prompt, llm=llm)

# Get the response
response = chain.run()
print(response)

```

### **6.3 Code Explanation:**

- **Chain-of-Thought Prompt**: The template explicitly asks the model to break the problem down into smaller steps.
- **LLMChain**: This processes the chain-of-thought reasoning to generate a more structured response.

**Expected Output:**

```
Let's solve this step by step:
1. Identify the problem: Understand the task at hand.
2. Break it down into smaller tasks: Subdivide the larger problem.
3. Find a solution to each task: Solve each sub-task individually.

```

## **Module 7: Building a Conversational Agent**

### **7.1 Multi-turn Conversations with LangChain**

LangChain excels at creating conversational agents that can handle multi-turn interactions. In this module, we will build an agent that can maintain context over several interactions.

### **7.2 Example of a Conversational Agent**

```python
from langchain.chains import ConversationChain

# Initialize conversation chain
conversation = ConversationChain(llm=OpenAI(temperature=0.7))

# Simulate a conversation
response1 = conversation.predict(input="Hello, what's your name?")
response2 = conversation.predict(input="What do you do?")
print(response1)
print(response2)

```

### **7.3 Code Explanation:**

- **ConversationChain**: This chain is designed for managing multi-turn conversations, allowing the agent to maintain context throughout.
- **Multi-turn Interaction**: The agent responds based on the previous interaction, making the conversation feel more natural.

**Expected Output:**

```
Response 1: Hello! I am an AI assistant.
Response 2: I am here to help you with any questions you may have.

```

def fetch_weather(location):
    url = f"<https://api.weatherapi.com/v1/current.json?key=YOUR_API_KEY&q={location}>"
    response = requests.get(url)
    return response.json()['current']['temp_c']

weather_tool = Tool(name="Weather API", func=fetch_weather, description="Get current weather data.")

# Use the tool
response = weather_tool.run("London")
print(f"The current temperature in London is {response}°C.")

```

### **8.3 Code Explanation:**

- **Weather API**: A simple function fetches the current temperature of a location using an external weather API.
