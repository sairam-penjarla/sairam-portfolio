# 1. Basics of RAG: Retrieval-Augmented Generation

## **What is RAG?**

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** is a hybrid architecture that combines the best of **retrieval-based systems** and **generative AI models**. Imagine large language models like GPT-4. They’re smart, but limited by the data they were trained on and can hallucinate (guess details incorrectly). RAG fixes this by empowering the model with **real-time external knowledge retrieval**.

In simple terms:

1. It retrieves **relevant knowledge** (documents, text chunks, data) from external sources like databases, APIs, Confluence pages, SharePoint, or even SQL tables.
2. It **augments the user's query** with this retrieved information.
3. It generates rich and context-aware responses by using both the **retrieved documents** and its own natural language capabilities.

## **Why Do We Need RAG?**

Generative AI models are great storytellers, but their lack of "situational awareness" can sometimes be problematic. Here's why RAG architecture is revolutionary:

1. **Up-to-Date Knowledge:**
Traditional language models are **static**, meaning they know only what they were trained on (no updates after training). RAG bridges the gap by retrieving real-world, up-to-date information.
2. **Increased Accuracy:**
By grounding responses in retrieved documents or data, RAG minimizes hallucinations and ensures the generated output aligns with factual evidence.
3. **Use Case Versatility:**
Whether you’re building a chatbot, an automation tool for generating SQL queries, or a smart assistant, RAG can adapt to various industries and workflows seamlessly.
4. **Context-Specific Responses:**
RAG tailors responses based on highly specialized company repositories or unique document types. This is perfect for scenarios like:
    - Generating insights from **Confluence documentation**.
    - Creating **database-based chatbots**.
    - Building **NLP-to-SQL assistants**.
    - Querying **SharePoint** repositories dynamically.
    - Maintaining **company-specific chatbots** enriched with custom knowledge.

## **How Companies Use RAG**

RAG architecture is like having a digital super-assistant that can "search, understand, and explain." Let’s explore its varied applications:

1. **Company Chatbots:**
Firms build internal chatbots powered by RAG to process company documentation & FAQs. Employees ask, "How do I apply for leave?"—and it retrieves info from an HR manual.
2. **NLP-to-SQL Query Assistants:**
    - RAG is used to retrieve schema, column definitions, or even API docs and then generate SQL queries dynamically based on user inputs. For instance, "Give me the total revenue for the last month."
3. **Confluence/SharePoint Chatbots:**
    - Enterprises leverage RAG to fetch knowledge nuggets from massive repositories like **Confluence pages**, **SharePoint documents**, or even live wikis—tailoring answers for employee workflows.
4. **Industry-Specific Knowledge Retrieval:**
    - RAG retrieves regulatory documents, compliance rules, or competitor reports, synthesizing them into actionable strategies.

## **The Ideal Prompt Structure for RAG**

Prompt engineering plays a critical role in guiding a RAG system effectively. Here’s how to structure a top-notch RAG-based prompt for maximum result accuracy:

### 1️⃣ **Goal (State Your Desired Outcome Clearly):**

- Define what you want the system to achieve explicitly.
- Example: "Create a comprehensive response to the user query based on HR policies and leave-related documents."

### 2️⃣ **Return Format (Define the Output Type):**

- Specify how the output should look—bullet points, tables, natural sentences, or JSON.
- Example: "Output the result as:
    - A single cohesive paragraph explaining the rules.
    - A bullet-point summary of leave policies."

### 3️⃣ **Warning (Set Boundaries for the Model):**

- Specify what the system **should not do**, like generating made-up facts or deviating from retrieved context.
- Example:
    - "Do not generate content not present in retrieved documents."
    - "Avoid adding speculative details or irrelevant information."

### 4️⃣ **Context Dump (The Data Source Backbone):**

- Ensure the prompts are contextualized with **retrieved information**. This is the keystone; it ensures factual grounding.
- Example context dump:
    
    ```python
    context = """
    1. Employees can apply for 25 days of annual leave.
    2. Leave requests must be submitted 7 days in advance.
    3. HR portal workflow requires manager approval.
    """
    
    ```
    
    Here’s what a complete RAG-enabled prompt would look like:
    
    ```
    Goal:
    - Generate an answer explaining leave application processes.
    
    Return Format:
    - Provide a paragraph and a bullet-point summary.
    
    Warning:
    - Do not include any assumptions not backed by retrieved data.
    - Do not deviate from the HR guidelines document.
    
    Context Dump:
    """
    1. Employees get 25 yearly leave days.
    2. Submit leave requests via the HR portal 7 days before the start date.
    3. Manager approval required before final submission.
    """
    
    ```
    
    **Result:**
    The RAG model will retrieve and synthesize results adhering strictly to this structure.
