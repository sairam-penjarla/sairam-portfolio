# Advanced Prompt Engineering Techniques

## What is Prompt Engineering?

Prompt engineering is the art and science of **designing effective inputs** to guide a Large Language Model (LLM) toward producing the desired output. The way you frame a request can dramatically change the **accuracy, style, and depth** of the response. Even though the model’s capabilities are fixed after training, a well-crafted prompt can **unlock better reasoning, creativity, and clarity** than a vague or minimal one.

Below are **four advanced techniques** with simple, easy-to-understand examples. For each, you’ll see:

- A **basic prompt** (without the technique)
- An **improved prompt** (using the technique)

## 1. Role-Based Prompting

Assigning the model a **specific role** helps it adopt the right tone, structure, and focus.

**Without Role-Based Prompting:**

```
Explain photosynthesis.

```

**With Role-Based Prompting:**

```
You are a friendly science teacher explaining photosynthesis to a 10-year-old using a fun story.

```

## 2. Self-Reflection Prompting

Ask the model to **review and improve its own output** for clarity, accuracy, or completeness.

**Without Self-Reflection Prompting:**

```
List three facts about the moon.

```

**With Self-Reflection Prompting:**

```
List three facts about the moon.
After listing them, review your own answer and correct or clarify any fact if needed.

```

## 3. Chain-of-Thought Prompting

Guide the model to **think step-by-step** before giving the final answer, which improves reasoning quality.

**Without Chain-of-Thought Prompting:**

```
What is 17 multiplied by 23?

```

**With Chain-of-Thought Prompting:**

```
Think step-by-step and explain your reasoning before giving the final answer: What is 17 multiplied by 23?

```

## 4. Few-Shot vs. Zero-Shot Prompting

### Zero-Shot Prompting

You ask the model to perform a task without giving examples.

```
Write a short poem about rain.

```

### Few-Shot Prompting

You give **a few examples** so the model can match style and format.

```
Example 1:
Rain falls softly,
whispering to the earth below,
dreams sprout overnight.

Example 2:
Silver threads descend,
dancing on the rooftops high,
peace hums through the night.

Now write a short poem about snow in the same style.
