## **Module 1: Getting Started with Hugging Face**

### **1.1 What is Hugging Face?**

Hugging Face is an AI community that provides access to an open-source library called **Transformers**. This library offers a wide array of pre-trained models for various NLP tasks like text generation, translation, and more. These models can be easily loaded and used in Python projects.

### **1.2 Setting Up Hugging Face**

To start working with Hugging Face, we first need to install the **Transformers** library. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
pip install transformers

```

This will install Hugging Face’s `transformers` package and its dependencies.

Once the package is installed, you can start using the pre-trained models.

## **Module 2: Loading and Using Pre-trained Models**

### **2.1 Using a Pre-trained Language Model**

Hugging Face provides a large variety of pre-trained models. In this section, we’ll explore how to load and use one of them, specifically the **GPT-2** model, which is a popular language model for text generation.

Here’s a basic example of how to load and use a pre-trained model for text generation:

```python
from transformers import GPT2LMHeadModel, GPT2Tokenizer

# Load pre-trained GPT-2 model and tokenizer
model_name = "gpt2"
model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained(model_name)
tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Encode input text
input_text = "Once upon a time"
inputs = tokenizer.encode(input_text, return_tensors="pt")

# Generate output from the model
outputs = model.generate(inputs, max_length=50, num_return_sequences=1)

# Decode and print the output
generated_text = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
print(generated_text)

```

### **2.2 Code Explanation:**

- **GPT2LMHeadModel** and **GPT2Tokenizer**: These are the model and tokenizer for GPT-2. The tokenizer converts the input text into tokens that the model can process, and the model generates the response.
- **model.generate**: This method is used to generate a sequence of tokens based on the input. You can control the length of the output using the `max_length` parameter.
- **tokenizer.decode**: This method decodes the generated tokens back into human-readable text.

**Expected Output:**

```
Once upon a time, there was a young prince named Henry who lived in a kingdom far, far away. He was known for his wisdom and kindness, and people loved him dearly...

```

## **Module 3: Text Classification with Hugging Face Models**

### **3.1 Introduction to Text Classification**

Text classification is a common NLP task where a model is trained to categorize text into predefined classes. Hugging Face provides many pre-trained models for text classification tasks, such as sentiment analysis, topic modeling, etc.

In this section, we’ll use a pre-trained model for **Sentiment Analysis**.

### **3.2 Sentiment Analysis with Hugging Face**

We’ll use the `distilbert-base-uncased` model for sentiment analysis.

```python
from transformers import pipeline

# Load sentiment analysis pipeline
classifier = pipeline("sentiment-analysis")

# Analyze sentiment of a sentence
result = classifier("I love using Hugging Face!")
print(result)

```

### **3.3 Code Explanation:**

- **pipeline**: The `pipeline` function in Hugging Face simplifies many NLP tasks, such as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, etc. In this example, it’s used to load a sentiment analysis model.
- **classifier**: This object is used to classify the sentiment of a given sentence.

**Expected Output:**

```json
[{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9998676776885986}]

```

The model classifies the sentence as **positive** with a high confidence score.

## **Module 4: Named Entity Recognition (NER)**

### **4.1 What is Named Entity Recognition (NER)?**

NER is an NLP task that involves identifying entities in text, such as names of people, organizations, and locations. Hugging Face provides a simple way to perform NER using pre-trained models.

### **4.2 Performing NER with Hugging Face**

```python
from transformers import pipeline

# Load NER pipeline
ner = pipeline("ner")

# Perform NER on a sample text
text = "Hugging Face is based in New York and was founded by Clément Delangue."
entities = ner(text)
print(entities)

```

### **4.3 Code Explanation:**

- **pipeline("ner")**: This loads a pre-trained model that can recognize named entities in the text.
- **ner(text)**: This function processes the input text and identifies any named entities such as persons, locations, and organizations.

**Expected Output:**

```json
[
  {'word': 'Hugging Face', 'score': 0.999, 'entity': 'ORG', 'start': 0, 'end': 12},
  {'word': 'New York', 'score': 0.998, 'entity': 'LOC', 'start': 32, 'end': 41},
  {'word': 'Clément Delangue', 'score': 0.999, 'entity': 'PER', 'start': 61, 'end': 78}
]

```

The output shows that the model identified three named entities:

- **Hugging Face** (Organization)
- **New York** (Location)
- **Clément Delangue** (Person)

## **Module 5: Fine-Tuning Pre-trained Models**

### **5.1 Introduction to Fine-Tuning**

Fine-tuning is the process of taking a pre-trained model and adapting it to a specific task or dataset. Hugging Face makes it easy to fine-tune models on custom datasets, whether you’re working on text classification, language generation, or other tasks.

### **5.2 Fine-Tuning a Model for Text Classification**

We’ll demonstrate fine-tuning a pre-trained model using a custom dataset for text classification.

```python
from transformers import Trainer, TrainingArguments
from datasets import load_dataset
from transformers import DistilBertForSequenceClassification, DistilBertTokenizer

# Load a pre-trained DistilBERT model and tokenizer
model = DistilBertForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("distilbert-base-uncased", num_labels=2)
tokenizer = DistilBertTokenizer.from_pretrained("distilbert-base-uncased")

# Load dataset
dataset = load_dataset("glue", "mrpc")

# Tokenize the dataset
def tokenize_function(examples):
    return tokenizer(examples["sentence1"], examples["sentence2"], padding="max_length", truncation=True)

tokenized_datasets = dataset.map(tokenize_function, batched=True)

# Set up training arguments
training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir="./results",
    evaluation_strategy="epoch",
    learning_rate=2e-5,
    per_device_train_batch_size=16,
    per_device_eval_batch_size=16,
    num_train_epochs=3,
)

# Initialize the Trainer
trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=tokenized_datasets["train"],
    eval_dataset=tokenized_datasets["validation"],
)

# Fine-tune the model
trainer.train()

```

### **5.3 Code Explanation:**

- **DistilBertForSequenceClassification**: This is a variant of BERT that is smaller and faster. We load it pre-trained, but we modify it for binary classification (MRPC dataset).
- **Trainer and TrainingArguments**: The `Trainer` class in Hugging Face simplifies the fine-tuning process. You define your training settings with `TrainingArguments`, such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs.
- **load_dataset**: We load a sample dataset (MRPC) to demonstrate fine-tuning. The dataset is tokenized before training.

## **Module 6: Question Answering with Hugging Face**

### **6.1 What is Question Answering?**

Question answering (QA) is a common NLP task where a model is given a passage of text and asked to answer specific questions based on that text. Hugging Face offers several pre-trained models that can handle this task.

### **6.2 Performing Question Answering**

We’ll use a pre-trained model to perform question answering over a text passage.

```python
from transformers import pipeline

# Load question answering pipeline
qa = pipeline("question-answering")

# Define context and question
context = """
Hugging Face is an AI company based in New York. It provides NLP tools such as the Transformers library.
"""
question = "Where is Hugging Face based?"

# Get the answer
answer = qa(question=question, context=context)
print(answer)

```

### **6.3 Code Explanation:**

- **pipeline("question-answering")**: This loads a pre-trained model that can handle question answering tasks.
- **qa(question=question, context=context)**: This function uses the provided context to answer the given question.

**Expected Output:**

```json
{'answer': 'New York', 'start': 39, 'end': 47, 'score': 0.99}

```

The model correctly answers the question based on the context provided.
