                <div class="prompt-content">I'm going to give you a complex reasoning problem. Please solve it step-by-step, showing your thinking process.

Example 1:
Problem: If John has 5 apples and gives 2 to Mary, then buys 3 more and gives half of all his apples to Susan, how many apples does John have left?
Reasoning: 
1. John starts with 5 apples
2. He gives 2 to Mary, leaving him with 5 - 2 = 3 apples
3. He buys 3 more, giving him 3 + 3 = 6 apples
4. He gives half of his 6 apples to Susan, which is 6 ÷ 2 = 3 apples
5. After giving 3 apples to Susan, John has 6 - 3 = 3 apples left
Answer: John has 3 apples left.

Example 2:
Problem: A train travels at 60 mph. How long will it take to travel 150 miles?
Reasoning:
1. We know that time = distance ÷ speed
2. Time = 150 miles ÷ 60 mph
3. Time = 2.5 hours
Answer: It will take 2.5 hours.

Now solve this problem:
