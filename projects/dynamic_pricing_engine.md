# Dynamic Pricing Engine

## Overview
The **Dynamic Pricing Engine** is a machine learning solution designed to help businesses optimize product prices. By analyzing historical sales data, seasonal trends, and demand fluctuations, the engine predicts the most profitable pricing for each product. This approach enables dynamic adjustments that can improve revenue while maintaining competitive pricing.

## Workflow
1. **Data Ingestion & Processing**  
   - Historical sales and product data are stored in **Databricks Delta Lake** for efficient querying and versioning.  
   - Data preprocessing includes handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and feature scaling.

2. **Model Training & Evaluation**  
   - Predictive models are built using **Scikit-learn** for traditional regression and **Keras** for neural network-based approaches.  
   - Hyperparameter tuning and tracking are managed using **Weights & Biases**.  
   - Model performance is evaluated using metrics such as RMSE and MAPE, ensuring reliable predictions.

3. **Model Deployment & Monitoring**  
   - Trained models are registered and versioned in **Databricks Model Registry**.  
   - The engine supports real-time inference or batch predictions for large product catalogs.  
   - Continuous monitoring ensures that model performance is tracked and retrained periodically as demand patterns evolve.

## Tech Stack
- **Python**: Data processing and model development.  
- **Databricks MLflow**: Experiment tracking and model management.  
- **Databricks Delta Lake**: High-performance data storage and versioning.  
- **Databricks Model Registry**: Model deployment and version control.  
- **Scikit-learn**: Regression modeling and feature engineering.  
- **Keras**: Neural network models for more complex patterns.  
- **Weights & Biases**: Experiment tracking and hyperparameter optimization.

## User Interaction
- Users can input product information, historical sales data, and desired pricing constraints through a web interface or API.  
- The engine outputs suggested optimal prices, along with confidence intervals and trend visualizations.  
- Interactive dashboards allow businesses to explore pricing strategies and simulate market scenarios.

## Impact
- Helps businesses increase revenue by adjusting prices dynamically according to demand and seasonality.  
- Reduces reliance on manual pricing strategies and heuristics.  
- Provides actionable insights for marketing, inventory management, and sales planning.
