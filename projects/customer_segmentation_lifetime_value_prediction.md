# Customer Segmentation & Lifetime Value Prediction

## Overview

This project focuses on segmenting customers and predicting their lifetime value (CLV) using machine learning techniques. By understanding customer behavior, businesses can improve targeted marketing, optimize retention strategies, and prioritize high-value customers.

## Workflow

1. **Data Collection & Cleaning**  
   - Gathered historical customer data from transactional records and engagement logs.  
   - Handled missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent formats using Python's Pandas library.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Used visualization tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn to identify patterns and insights.  
   - Analyzed purchase frequency, recency, and monetary value to inform segmentation.

3. **Customer Segmentation**  
   - Applied clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering) to group similar customers.  
   - Evaluated segment quality using silhouette scores and domain knowledge.

4. **Lifetime Value Prediction**  
   - Trained regression and neural network models using Scikit-learn, Keras, and TensorFlow to predict customer lifetime value.  
   - Monitored model performance using validation metrics and experiment tracking with Weights & Biases.

5. **Model Deployment & Demo**  
   - Created a platform-independent demo to visualize customer segments and predicted CLV.  
   - Provided interactive charts and dashboards for actionable insights.
