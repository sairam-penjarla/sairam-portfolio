# Domain-Specific Q&A Knowledge Base

## Overview

This project is an AI-powered knowledge base designed to help users quickly find accurate answers from domain-specific documents. It is particularly useful for organizational contexts, such as **HR policies, compliance documents, and internal guidelines**, enabling employees to retrieve information efficiently without manually searching through large repositories.

The system leverages **GPT-4** and OpenAI Agents for natural language understanding, along with **Azure Cognitive Search** and **ChromaDB** for document indexing and retrieval.

## Workflow

1. **Document Ingestion**
   - Domain-specific documents (PDFs, Word files, or web content) are ingested and processed.
   - Text is cleaned, tokenized, and embedded into a vector database (ChromaDB).

2. **Search & Retrieval**
   - User queries are analyzed using GPT-4 to understand intent.
   - Relevant documents and sections are retrieved from ChromaDB via semantic search.

3. **Answer Generation**
   - Retrieved content is summarized or directly used to answer queries.
   - OpenAI Agents coordinate multi-step reasoning when a query requires combining information from multiple documents.

4. **User Interaction**
   - Users can ask natural language questions through a web interface.
   - Responses include source references for transparency and trustworthiness.
