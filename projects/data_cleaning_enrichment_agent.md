# Data Cleaning + Enrichment Agent

In today’s data-driven world, the quality of datasets defines the success of downstream analytics, AI models, and business intelligence. Raw data often comes with inconsistencies, missing values, and poor structure. Without proper handling, these issues can derail even the most advanced systems.

The **Data Cleaning + Enrichment Agent** is designed to solve this problem through an automated, intelligent workflow. It preprocesses raw client datasets, removes errors, fills in gaps, and enriches information so that the data is not just clean—but also meaningful.

## Why This Project Matters

Every organization collects data from multiple sources—CRM systems, spreadsheets, user logs, or third-party tools. However, these inputs are rarely standardized. A dataset might contain duplicate entries, mismatched formats, or incomplete records. Cleaning this data manually is time-consuming and error-prone.

This project takes on the heavy lifting, allowing teams to focus on analysis and decision-making rather than repetitive data wrangling. By combining automation with AI-driven enrichment, the agent ensures that the resulting dataset is accurate, structured, and value-added.

## How It Works

1. **Data Ingestion**
   The agent accepts raw client datasets from any platform, since it is **platform independent**.

2. **Preprocessing with Pandas**
   Using Python’s **Pandas** library, the system performs standard cleaning tasks—handling missing values, removing duplicates, normalizing formats, and restructuring tables.

3. **AI-Driven Enrichment**
   Leveraging **OpenAI Agents** and **GPT-4**, the system enriches datasets with contextual intelligence. For instance, it can auto-complete missing fields, generate descriptive summaries, or categorize unstructured text.

4. **Knowledge Storage with ChromaDB**
   Enriched data is stored and indexed using **ChromaDB**, making it easily retrievable for future analysis and ensuring scalability as the dataset grows.
