# Invoice & Receipt Data Extractor

## Overview
The Invoice & Receipt Data Extractor is an AI-powered solution designed to transform scanned invoices and receipts into structured, actionable data. By combining computer vision and natural language processing (NLP), the system automates manual data entry, enabling analytics dashboards and streamlined financial reporting.

## Workflow
1. **Input Processing:**  
   - Users upload scanned invoices or receipt images.
   - Images are preprocessed using OpenCV to enhance clarity, correct orientation, and remove noise.

2. **Text Extraction (OCR):**  
   - TensorFlow/Keras-based models identify and extract text from images.
   - Azure Document Intelligence enhances recognition accuracy for various document layouts.

3. **Natural Language Processing:**  
   - spaCy and NLTK process extracted text to identify key entities (e.g., vendor, date, line items, totals).
   - Rules and pattern matching refine extraction for structured outputs.

4. **Data Structuring & Visualization:**  
   - Extracted data is organized into a consistent format using Pandas.
   - Visual dashboards and reports are generated using Plotly for insights like spending trends or vendor analysis.

5. **Output & Integration:**  
   - Cleaned, structured datasets can be exported in CSV/Excel formats.
   - Optionally integrated with downstream analytics tools or business workflows.
