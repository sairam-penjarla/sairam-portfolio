## Primary Visual Composition & Layout

Create a portrait-oriented religious invitation card with perfect symmetrical balance and centered vertical alignment. The composition flows seamlessly from top to bottom in this exact hierarchy: ornate Lord Ganesha deity illustration at the crown, followed by decorative title text, warm invitation prose, prominently featured date/time details in a structured block format, supplementary event information, gracious closing sentiment, and finally the host family name as the foundation anchor.

## Detailed Background & Texture Specifications

Render a sophisticated soft pastel pinkish-beige background with authentic vintage watercolor wash texture, resembling aged parchment or handmade paper. The background should exhibit subtle organic variations in tone and saturation, with gentle gradients that create depth without competing with foreground elements. Include delicate paper grain texture, slight color bleeding effects typical of watercolor, and barely perceptible aging marks that suggest reverence and timeless tradition. The overall effect should evoke warmth, sanctity, and heritage.

## Comprehensive Color Palette & Application

- **Primary Background**: Warm pinkish-beige (#F5E6D3 to #EDD5C0 gradient) with watercolor transparency effects
- **Primary Text & Accent Color**: Deep maroon/wine red (#8B1538 to #A0284A) for all typography and ornamental elements
- **Secondary Pink Tones**: Soft rose pink (#E8B4C8) to deeper blush (#D48FB0) for lotus petals and Ganesha’s skin

- **Metallic Gold**: Warm antique gold (#DAA520) for divine ornaments, crown, and jewelry
- **Neutral Earth Tones**: Warm beige and soft brown (#D2B48C) for skin undertones and shadowing

## Intricate Border Design & Ornamental Patterns

Craft elaborate corner decorations featuring traditional Indian mehndi-inspired motifs rendered in the deep maroon color scheme. Each corner should showcase:

- **Top Corners**: Symmetrical spiral flourishes with paisley elements, vine tendrils, and delicate leaf patterns that curve inward toward the center, creating a natural frame for the header area
- **Bottom Corners**: Complementary but lighter swirling designs with lotus bud motifs and flowing curves that provide visual closure without overwhelming the family name
- **Horizontal Dividers**: Position two ornate separator lines above and below the date block, each featuring a central medallion with radiating filigree patterns, delicate scrollwork, and traditional geometric elements
- All patterns should maintain consistent line weight, exhibit perfect symmetry, and demonstrate the intricate craftsmanship of traditional Indian decorative arts
