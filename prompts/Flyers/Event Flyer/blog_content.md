Create a vibrant, energetic flyer for a Holi festival celebration. The scene should depict an explosion of powdered colors — pinks, blues, yellows, greens, and purples — bursting into the air with people celebrating joyfully in the background. At the top or center, place the title in large, bold, playful font: 'Holi Hai! – Festival of Colors'. Leave a blank, lightly bordered placeholder box at the bottom or corner for 'Venue / Date / Time' — styled subtly so it's clear it's a placeholder to be filled in later, but doesn’t distract from the colorful visuals. The style should blend modern event poster design with traditional Indian decorative elements like soft rangoli patterns or subtle mandalas around the corners or background. The meticulous lighting and composition highlight the flyer. Make the environment a bright, festive outdoor setting with sunny skies, trees faintly visible in the backdrop, and a cheerful crowd dancing and throwing colors. This visually stunning depiction, whether through a digital painting or an immaculate photograph, exhibits extraordinary attention to detail. The scene takes place in a sunlit outdoor park during the peak of the festivities. The background is filled with a lively crowd of men, women, and children — all wearing traditional white or light-colored clothes now soaked and stained with vivid splashes of pink, yellow, blue, orange, and green powders. Every face in the crowd shows expressions of unfiltered joy — laughter, excitement, dancing, and cheering. The design should feel full of life, motion, and joy. Use bold, saturated colors with dynamic movement of powder in the air.

## Prompt - 2

Create a surreal, dreamy, and artistic flyer for a Holi festival celebration. The overall composition should be more abstract and conceptual than literal — think watercolor blends, ethereal light glows, and floating color clouds merging seamlessly into the background. Depict vibrant swirls of powdered pigments — pink, teal, saffron, violet, and lime — drifting through the air like smoke or nebulae, creating soft gradients across the flyer.

Position the title 'Holi Hai! – Festival of Colors' at the center or top, in a fluid, hand-painted or calligraphic font that looks like it’s been brushed onto the canvas with color dust. The typography should be a visual element — vibrant, creative, and integral to the artwork, not just overlaid.

Instead of a realistic crowd, illustrate playful human silhouettes or painterly figures — mid-dance, throwing color, and caught in expressive motion — as though they're part of the artwork itself. 

At the bottom or in a floating corner, include a subtle placeholder box for 'Venue / Date / Time' — styled like a brushstroke panel or abstract frame, soft-edged and unobtrusive, with light border accents.

Incorporate faint traditional Indian motifs like rangoli spirals, decorative floral flourishes, or miniature elephants, hidden in the background like visual Easter eggs — softly blending into the watercolor clouds. The final result should look like a modern art poster — poetic, joyful, and culturally rich, evoking the magical and playful spirit of Holi rather than capturing it literally. Render in a mixed-media digital painting style, with soft textures, delicate layering, and dreamlike lighting.

## Prompt - 3

Create a clean and modern flyer for a Holi festival celebration with a balanced, minimalist layout. Use a soft white or light pastel background with a few carefully placed splashes of powdered Holi colors — pink, yellow, green, blue — in the corners or subtly faded into the background. Avoid clutter. Place a joyful but not overly detailed illustration or photo of people throwing colors in the middle or lower part of the flyer — silhouettes or softly blurred figures that convey the feeling of the celebration without taking focus from the text.

At the top, include the event title in clear, modern sans-serif or semi-serif font: 'Holi Hai! – Festival of Colors'. Keep it bold but elegant — easily readable at a glance.

Leave a simple rectangular placeholder box at the bottom labeled 'Venue / Date / Time' in small, light gray text. It should be clean, unobtrusive, and clearly meant to be filled in later.

Avoid ornate patterns or heavy textures. Keep the flyer spacious, bright, and balanced — a mix of celebratory energy and modern design simplicity. Add just enough color to evoke Holi without overwhelming the viewer."
