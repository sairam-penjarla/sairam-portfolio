Elena Siobhan Carpathia, Her (dark brown eyes) are accentuated with smoky shadows.  a woman with curly red hair and a fair complexion, featuring a pensive or contemplative expression. She is wearing a form-fitting, pale bodice that has a historical or possibly fantastical design, indicative of a character that may belong to a different era or a storybook tale. The setting behind her, which includes gothic arches and hints of a grand architecture, reinforces this impression, adding to the portrait's timeless and narrative-driven ambiance.Her attire and the setting suggest a blend of elegance and strength, with an almost regal or aristocratic air about her. The image is rich in detail, from the texture of her clothing to the soft lighting that illuminates her features and hair, creating a striking contrast and depth. by Conrad Roset, Pino Daeni, Jeremy Mann, Alex Maleev, 16k resolution
