Their clothing is soaked, adding to the sense of urgency and desperation. The background depicts a dark, star-filled night sky and a vast, tumultuous ocean. The sinking ship looms ominously in the distance, with smoke billowing from its funnels and the sound of metal groaning and creaking as it breaks apart. Lifeboats dot the water, some filled with survivors. The scene is captured with bokeh-style macro photography, highlighting the intricate details of the figures and setting.

His hands are bound in handcuffs, but his expression is one of gleeful madness as he claps his hands together with mocking applause. The cell bars cast dramatic shadows across the scene, emphasizing the confinement of the Joker's surroundings. In the background, the dimly lit jail cell is adorned with graffiti and scratches, hinting at the chaos and disorder of the Joker's world. This miniature design captures the Joker's twisted sense of humor and defiance, while the bokeh-style macro photography accentuates the intricate details of the scene.
