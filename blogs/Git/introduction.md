## **Module 1: What is Git and Why Should You Use It?**

### **What is Git?**

Git is a free and open-source version control system that tracks changes in files. It allows multiple developers to collaborate on the same project without overwriting each other’s work. Git records changes to files over time and allows you to revert back to earlier versions, merge code from different developers, and track what’s been done to your project.

### **Why Use Git?**

Here are some key reasons why Git is so popular:

- **Version Tracking**: Git tracks every change made to your codebase, so you can view the history of changes and undo mistakes.
- **Collaboration**: Git enables multiple people to work on the same codebase, and it helps to avoid conflicts between different developers' changes.
- **Branching and Merging**: Git allows developers to work on different branches of a project. These branches can be merged back together when they’re ready.
- **Backup and Safety**: You can push your code to remote repositories (like GitHub or GitLab) for secure backups.

## **Module 2: Getting Started with Git**

### **Step 1: Installing Git**

Before you can start using Git, you need to install it on your computer. Here's how to install Git:

### **Installing on Windows:**

1. Download the Git installer from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).
2. Run the installer and follow the installation instructions.

### **Installing on macOS:**

On macOS, you can use Homebrew:

```bash
brew install git

```

Alternatively, you can download the installer from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).

### **Installing on Linux:**

On Linux, you can install Git using the package manager:

```bash
sudo apt install git   # For Debian/Ubuntu-based systems
sudo yum install git   # For RedHat/CentOS-based systems

```

### **Step 2: Configuring Git**

Once Git is installed, configure it with your name and email address. This information will be used to identify your commits.

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"

```

### **Step 3: Initialize a Git Repository**

To start using Git for version control, you need to initialize a Git repository in your project directory.

Navigate to your project folder and run the following command:

```bash
git init

```

This creates a `.git` folder in your project directory, which stores all the version history and configuration data.

---

## **Module 3: Basic Git Commands**

Now that we have Git set up, let’s dive into some basic Git commands to start tracking your changes.

### **Step 1: Checking the Status**

You can check the status of your repository at any time to see which files are modified, added, or untracked.

```bash
git status

```

### **Explanation:**

This will show you the current state of the repository. For example, if you’ve modified a file, it will show up as “modified.”

---

### **Step 2: Adding Files to the Staging Area**

Before you can commit changes, you need to add them to the staging area.

### **Code Example 1: Add a Single File**

```bash
git add filename.txt

```

### **Code Example 2: Add All Files**

```bash
git add .

```

### **Explanation:**

- `git add filename.txt` adds a specific file to the staging area.
- `git add .` adds all modified files in the directory to the staging area.

---

### **Step 3: Committing Changes**

Once your changes are staged, you can commit them to the Git repository. A commit is a snapshot of your project at a specific point in time.

```bash
git commit -m "Your commit message"

```

### **Explanation:**

The `-m` flag is used to provide a commit message, which describes the changes you made. It’s a good practice to write meaningful commit messages to explain why the changes were made.

---

### **Step 4: Viewing the Commit History**

You can view the history of your commits using the following command:

```bash
git log

```

### **Explanation:**

This command shows a list of commits made in the repository, starting with the most recent. Each commit has a unique ID (called a commit hash), the author’s name, and the commit message.

---

## **Module 4: Branching and Merging in Git**

One of Git’s most powerful features is the ability to create branches, which allow you to work on different features or versions of your project independently.

### **Step 1: Creating a Branch**

To create a new branch, use the following command:

```bash
git branch new-branch-name

```

### **Explanation:**

This creates a new branch called `new-branch-name`. However, it doesn’t switch you to that branch. To switch to the new branch, use:

```bash
git checkout new-branch-name

```

Alternatively, you can combine both steps into one with:

```bash
git checkout -b new-branch-name

```

---

### **Step 2: Merging Branches**

Once you’ve made changes in your branch and committed them, you can merge them back into the main branch (often called `master` or `main`).

First, switch to the branch you want to merge changes into (e.g., `main`):

```bash
git checkout main

```

Then, run the following command to merge the changes from your branch:

```bash
git merge new-branch-name

```

### **Explanation:**

- `git checkout main` switches you to the `main` branch.
- `git merge new-branch-name` merges the changes from `new-branch-name` into `main`.

---

## **Module 5: Working with Remote Repositories**

Git allows you to work with remote repositories, such as those on GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket. This is crucial for collaboration and backup.

### **Step 1: Adding a Remote Repository**

To link your local Git repository to a remote repository (like GitHub), use the following command:

```bash
git remote add origin <https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git>

```

### **Explanation:**

This command tells Git where to push and pull changes. Replace the URL with the actual URL of your repository.

---

### **Step 2: Pushing Changes to the Remote Repository**

To upload your local changes to the remote repository, use:

```bash
git push origin main

```

### **Explanation:**

- `origin` is the default name for the remote repository.
- `main` is the branch you're pushing to (you can replace it with any branch name).

---

### **Step 3: Pulling Changes from the Remote Repository**

If you want to update your local repository with the latest changes from the remote repository, use:

```bash
git pull origin main

```

### **Explanation:**

This command fetches the changes from the remote `main` branch and merges them into your local branch.

---

## **Module 6: Reverting Changes in Git**

### **What is Reverting?**

Sometimes, you may need to undo a commit that you’ve made to your repository. Git provides multiple ways to revert changes, depending on whether you want to undo a commit, reset the repository, or simply create a new commit that undoes the changes made in a previous commit.

### **Reverting a Commit**

If you want to undo a commit but keep the commit history intact (i.e., you don’t want to remove it from the history), you can use the `git revert` command. This creates a new commit that undoes the changes of a previous commit.

### **Code Example: Reverting a Commit**

```bash
git revert <commit-hash>

```

### **Explanation:**

- `<commit-hash>`: This is the identifier (SHA) of the commit you want to revert. You can find the commit hash using `git log`.

### **Example:**

```bash
git revert a1b2c3d4

```

This command will create a new commit that undoes the changes introduced by commit `a1b2c3d4`.

---

### **Step 2: Reverting Multiple Commits**

If you want to revert a series of commits, you can pass a range of commits:

```bash
git revert <oldest-commit-hash>^..<newest-commit-hash>

```

### **Example:**

```bash
git revert a1b2c3d4^..f5e6d7c8

```

This will revert all commits between `a1b2c3d4` and `f5e6d7c8`.

### **What Happens After Reverting?**

- Git will create new commits to reverse the changes made in the original commits.
- If you’re working with a team, they can simply pull the changes and apply the revert.

---

## **Module 7: Resetting Changes in Git**

While `git revert` creates new commits to undo changes, you can also use `git reset` to undo commits and move the HEAD (the current working directory) to a previous state. The difference is that `git reset` modifies the commit history itself.

### **Soft Reset: Keeping Changes in the Staging Area**

A **soft reset** allows you to move HEAD to a previous commit but keep your changes in the staging area, so you can re-commit them.

```bash
git reset --soft <commit-hash>

```

### **Explanation:**

- This moves the HEAD to the specified commit but keeps your changes staged for commit.

### **Example:**

```bash
git reset --soft HEAD~1

```

This command moves HEAD one commit back but keeps the changes staged.

---

### **Mixed Reset: Keeping Changes in the Working Directory**

A **mixed reset** will reset the commit history and unstage the changes, but your changes will still be in your working directory.

```bash
git reset --mixed <commit-hash>

```

### **Example:**

```bash
git reset --mixed HEAD~1

```

This will undo the last commit but keep your local changes (the changes will be unstaged).

---

### **Hard Reset: Discarding Changes**

A **hard reset** will reset both the commit history and the working directory. Any changes in your working directory will be lost.

```bash
git reset --hard <commit-hash>

```

### **Example:**

```bash
git reset --hard HEAD~1

```

This command will reset the last commit and discard all changes in your working directory.

---

## **Module 8: Resolving Merge Conflicts**

When you work on a team with multiple developers, merge conflicts are bound to happen. Merge conflicts occur when two branches have changes to the same line of a file and Git cannot automatically merge them. Here's how to handle merge conflicts.

### **What is a Merge Conflict?**

A **merge conflict** happens when Git is unable to automatically merge changes from different branches. Git marks the conflicting areas in the file and asks the developer to resolve them manually.

### **How to Resolve a Merge Conflict**

1. **Identify Conflicted Files**: Run `git status` to see which files are conflicted.
2. **Open the Conflicted Files**: Git will mark the conflicting areas with markers like:
    
    ```
    <<<<<<< HEAD
    Your changes here
    =======
    Changes from the other branch here
    >>>>>>> branch-name
    
    ```
    
    You’ll need to decide how to merge these changes: either keep your changes, keep the changes from the other branch, or combine both.
    
3. **Remove the Conflict Markers**: After resolving the conflict, make sure to delete the markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`).
4. **Stage and Commit the Changes**: After resolving the conflict, stage the file and commit the changes.
    
    ```bash
    git add <file>
    git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict in <file>"
    
    ```
    

---

## **Module 9: Advanced Git Branching**

Git allows for advanced branching strategies, especially useful in large teams or open-source projects. These strategies include **feature branching**, **release branches**, and **hotfixes**.

### **Feature Branching Workflow**

1. Create a new branch for each new feature or bugfix:
    
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/feature-name
    
    ```
    
2. Once the feature is complete, merge it into the `main` branch:
    
    ```bash
    git checkout main
    git merge feature/feature-name
    
    ```
    
3. Delete the feature branch after merging:
    
    ```bash
    git branch -d feature/feature-name
    
    ```
    

---

### **Git Flow**

The **Git Flow** is a branching model that standardizes how branches should be created and merged. It involves the following branches:

- **`main`**: Stores production-ready code.
- **`develop`**: Stores the latest development changes.
- **`feature`**: Feature branches for new functionality.
- **`release`**: Prepares code for release.
- **`hotfix`**: Used to quickly fix issues in production.

---

## **Module 10: Stashing Changes in Git**

Sometimes, you might be working on a task, but you need to switch to another branch temporarily without committing your changes. In such cases, you can **stash** your changes.

### **Stashing Changes**

```bash
git stash

```

This will save your changes and revert your working directory to the state of the last commit.

### **Listing Stashes**

To list all the stashes:

```bash
git stash list

```

### **Applying Stashed Changes**

To apply the latest stash:

```bash
git stash apply

```

You can also apply a specific stash by specifying the stash index:

```bash
git stash apply stash@{2}

```

### **Dropping a Stash**

Once you no longer need a stash, you can delete it:

```bash
git stash drop stash@{2}

```

## **Best Practices for Git**

Here are some best practices to follow when using Git:

- **Commit Often**: Make small commits frequently rather than large, infrequent ones. This makes it easier to track changes and revert to previous versions if needed.
- **Write Meaningful Commit Messages**: Describe what changes you made and why in the commit message.
- **Use Branches**: Always use branches for new features or bug fixes. This keeps your main branch clean and stable.
- **Collaborate with Pull Requests**: When working with others, use pull requests to review and merge changes. This ensures code quality and avoids conflicts.

---

## **Conclusion**

Git is a powerful tool that every developer should learn. By understanding the basics of Git, such as committing, branching, and working with remote repositories, you'll be able to manage your code more effectively and collaborate with others.

### **Key Takeaways**

- **Version Control**: Git tracks changes in your code and allows you to revert to previous versions.
- **Collaboration**: Git enables multiple developers to work on the same project without overwriting each other’s work.
- **Remote Repositories**: Git allows you to work with remote repositories like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket.
