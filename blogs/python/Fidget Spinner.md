**Get Spinning with Python's Turtle: Create a Fun Fidget Spinner Simulator!**  

This post is for the fidgeters, the curious coders, and anyone who loves interactive Python projects. We’re building a **Fidget Spinner Simulator** using Python’s built-in **Turtle graphics** module — no extra libraries required!

---

## 🎯 Dive into the Project

This project uses Python’s `turtle` module to draw and animate a fidget spinner right on your screen. Here's what makes it fun:

- **🖱️ Interactive Spinning**  
  Press the **spacebar** to "flick" the spinner. Each press makes it spin faster!

- **🐢 Turtle Graphics in Action**  
  The `turtle` module drives the graphics and animation.

- **🎨 Custom Colors**  
  Customize the spinner’s colors to match your mood or style.

## 🛠️ Get Set to Spin!

### ✅ Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x**  
  Confirm with:  
  ```bash
  python3 --version
  ```

- **Turtle Module**  
  Already included with Python — no extra installation needed!

---

### 📦 Installation and Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sairam-penjarla/Fidget-spinner.git
   cd Fidget-spinner
   ```

2. **Run the Script**  
   No dependencies to install — just run:  
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Start Spinning!**  
   The spinner will appear on your screen. Press the **spacebar** to flick it and watch it spin. Each press adds speed, and simulated **friction** gradually slows it down.

---

## 🌀 Example in Action

- At launch, the spinner is still.  
- Press the **spacebar** — it spins!  
- Keep pressing to build up speed.  
- Let go and watch as friction gradually slows it down, just like a real fidget spinner!
