## 🖌️ Creating Mosaics: Let the Fun Begin!

### 🧷 Prepare Your Images  
Place your input images in a folder named `input` within the project directory.

### ▶️ Run the Script  
From your terminal:  
```bash
python dot_mosaic.py
```

### 🛠️ Customize and Convert  
You can use the main function like this:

```python
create_dot_mosaic('input/1.jpg', dot_size=10, background="black", output_path='output/1.png')
```

This will:
- Convert `1.jpg` into a mosaic
- Use dots of size 10
- Set a **black** background
- Save the result as `1.png` in the `output` folder

Repeat for as many images as you'd like — tweak the parameters for creative variety!

## 🖼️ Witness the Mosaic Magic

Once the script runs, your transformed images will be saved in the `output` folder.  
Go ahead — print them, post them, or just admire your mosaic creations.
