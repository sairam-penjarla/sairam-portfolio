## ü¶† **The Urgency of Face Mask Detection**

In response to the global **COVID-19 pandemic**, face masks became a critical measure to prevent the spread of the virus. However, ensuring that people consistently follow mask-wearing guidelines, especially in public spaces, can be challenging.

This is where **face mask detection technology** becomes essential. Automated systems can be deployed for various purposes:

- **Monitoring mask usage** in places like transportation hubs, schools, and workplaces, providing real-time feedback.
- **Enhancing security camera systems**, adding an additional layer of insight to existing surveillance footage.
- **Tracking mask usage trends** anonymously in public areas for research or policy-making purposes.

## ü§ù **A Collaborative Effort: Research Behind the Scenes**

Face mask detection is an ongoing area of active research in the field of **computer vision**. Numerous researchers and institutions worldwide are contributing to the development of models for more accurate and efficient detection. Some notable papers include:

- **A Survey of Deep Learning Techniques for Face Mask Detection** (2020) by Md. Zahidul Islam et al. ‚Äî This paper discusses various deep learning techniques used for mask detection.
- **Real-time Face Mask Detection and Recognition Using Deep Learning** (2020) by S. Islam et al. ‚Äî Proposes a real-time face mask detection system that incorporates facial landmark recognition.
- **Automatic Face Mask Detection in Dense Crowds** (2020) by Chih-Wei Chen et al. ‚Äî Addresses the challenge of detecting face masks in crowded environments with partial face occlusions.

New research continues to emerge, making this a dynamic and evolving field.

## üèóÔ∏è **The Project in Action: Building Your Own Face Mask Detector**

This project utilizes the **TensorFlow** library to train a model that can detect face masks in images. The model is trained on a dataset containing faces with and without masks. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the project's components:

- **config.py**: Stores configuration settings for the face mask detection model.
- **utils.py**: Contains helper functions for data loading and preprocessing.
- **main.py**: Manages data loading, model construction, training, and evaluation.
- **detect_webcam.py**: Utilizes your webcam for real-time face mask detection.

## üöÄ **Getting Started: Prepare for Detection!**

Here‚Äôs a step-by-step guide to set up and run your face mask detection system:

### 1. **Clone the Codebase**  
Grab the project‚Äôs code with:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sairam-penjarla/Face-Mask-Detection.git
```

### 2. **Install Dependencies**  
The project relies on external libraries like TensorFlow. Install them using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. **Data Acquisition**  
You‚Äôll need a dataset for training. Download the **face mask dataset** from **Kaggle** (the link is provided in the YouTube video description: [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NgRQHHjpvM)) and place it in the directory specified in `config.py` (typically `./data`).

### 4. **Train the Model**  
Train the model by running:

```bash
python main.py
```

This command will load the data, build the model, train it, and evaluate its performance. Once trained, the model will be saved as **`face_mask_detection_model.h5`**.

### 5. **Real-time Detection in Action**  
To see the model in action, run the following command:

```bash
python detect_webcam.py
```

This will activate your webcam and start real-time face mask detection. The system will process video frames from your webcam, identify faces, and predict whether the person is wearing a mask.
