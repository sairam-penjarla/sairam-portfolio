## ü§ñ **Outsmart CAPTCHAs with Deep Learning**

CAPTCHAs (Completely Automated Public Turing tests to tell Computers and Humans Apart) are a ubiquitous challenge on websites, designed to differentiate humans from automated bots. While CAPTCHAs serve their purpose, they can often be an obstacle to users trying to access valuable content. 

This project leverages the power of **deep learning** to solve this challenge. Using a **pre-trained deep learning model**, the system analyzes a CAPTCHA image and predicts the underlying text, effectively bypassing the CAPTCHA and granting you access.

## üåê **A User-Friendly Solution: Web Interface**

This project doesn‚Äôt just focus on the technical aspects; it also prioritizes user experience. It features a **user-friendly web interface** built using **Flask**, a popular Python web framework. Here‚Äôs what you can expect:

- **Effortless CAPTCHA Uploads**: Simply upload the CAPTCHA image, and the project takes care of the rest.
- **Clear Text Recognition**: The predicted text from the CAPTCHA image is displayed on the web interface, helping you access the desired content effortlessly.

## üöÄ **Setting Up Your CAPTCHA Slayer**

Follow these steps to get started with this CAPTCHA-crushing project:

### 1. **Clone the Codebase**  
Grab the project‚Äôs code using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sairam-penjarla/cAPTCHA-identification.git
cd cAPTCHA-identification
```

### 2. **Install Dependencies**  
The project relies on external libraries. Install them using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. **Pre-Trained Model Download**  
The project uses a pre-trained deep learning model for text recognition. Download the model and place it in the `model` directory as specified in the `main.py` file.

### 4. **Launch the Application**  
Now that everything is set up, you can run the project with the following commands:

```bash
python main.py
python app.py
```

- The first command (`main.py`) prepares the model for predictions.
- The second command (`app.py`) launches the **Flask web application**.

### 5. **Access the Web Interface**  
Open your web browser and go to [http://127.0.0.1:5000/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/) to access the CAPTCHA text recognition interface.

## üñ•Ô∏è **Utilizing the Web Interface**

Once you have the application running, the web interface is simple to navigate:

- **Upload your CAPTCHA image**: Visit the provided web address and select the CAPTCHA image you want to decipher.
- **Click the upload button**: The system will process the image and display the predicted text from the CAPTCHA.
