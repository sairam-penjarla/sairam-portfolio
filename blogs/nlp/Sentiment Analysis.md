# üí¨ Sentiment Analysis Using Machine Learning  
**üìÖ Date:** June 26, 2024  

Explore the power of machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) by building your own sentiment analysis system. In this project, we use real-world tweet data and multiple ML algorithms to classify sentiments as *positive* or *negative*. Whether you're a data scientist or just exploring NLP, this guide walks you through every step ‚Äî from preprocessing text to deploying models.

## üß† Theory Behind Sentiment Analysis

### What Is Sentiment Analysis?  
Sentiment analysis is the process of identifying the emotional tone behind words. It helps companies track customer feedback, monitor brand reputation, and gauge public opinion ‚Äî all through the lens of machine learning.

### Why Machine Learning?  
With labeled data, we can train models that recognize patterns in text and classify new data accordingly. This allows automated, scalable sentiment analysis.

## üõ†Ô∏è Step-by-Step Implementation

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Importing Required Libraries  
We use Python‚Äôs rich ecosystem of libraries for:
- Data manipulation: `pandas`, `numpy`
- Text cleaning: `re`, `WordNetLemmatizer`
- Visualization: `seaborn`, `matplotlib`, `WordCloud`
- Machine learning: `scikit-learn`
- Model persistence: `pickle`

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Loading and Preparing Data

We load a tweet dataset and convert labels:
```python
dataset = pd.read_csv('...csv', encoding="ISO-8859-1", names=columns)
dataset = dataset[['sentiment', 'text']]
dataset['sentiment'] = dataset['sentiment'].replace(4, 1)
```
- Sentiment `0`: Negative  
- Sentiment `1`: Positive

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Text Preprocessing

Clean the tweets using a custom `preprocess()` function:
- Convert to lowercase
- Replace URLs and usernames
- Normalize repeated characters
- Lemmatize words
- Remove non-alphanumerics  

This ensures uniformity for vectorization.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Splitting Data

```python
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(..., test_size=0.05)
```

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Extraction: TF-IDF

We use `TfidfVectorizer` to convert text into numeric form:
```python
vectoriser = TfidfVectorizer(ngram_range=(1,2), max_features=500000)
X_train = vectoriser.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test = vectoriser.transform(X_test)
```

---

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Model Training & Evaluation

We train 3 classifiers:

```python
BNBmodel = BernoulliNB(alpha=2)
SVCmodel = LinearSVC()
LRmodel  = LogisticRegression(C=2, max_iter=1000)
```

Evaluate using a confusion matrix + classification report:
```python
def model_Evaluate(model): ...
```

---

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Saving Models

```python
pickle.dump(vectoriser, open('vectoriser.pickle', 'wb'))
pickle.dump(LRmodel, open('Sentiment-LR.pickle', 'wb'))
```

---

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ Loading Models

```python
def load_models():
    vectoriser = pickle.load(open(...))
    model = pickle.load(open(...))
    return vectoriser, model
```

---

### 9Ô∏è‚É£ Making Predictions

```python
def predict(vectoriser, model, text):
    textdata = vectoriser.transform(preprocess(text))
    predictions = model.predict(textdata)
    return pd.DataFrame({'text': text, 'sentiment': predictions})
```

Example:
```python
text = ["I hate twitter", "May the Force be with you."]
df = predict(vectoriser, model, text)
```
