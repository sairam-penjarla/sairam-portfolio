# **Module 2:**

Now that you understand the basics, letâ€™s dive into loops and functions, which are essential for writing efficient Python code.

## **1. For Loops**

A `for` loop is used to iterate over a sequence (like a list or a string).

```python
for x in range(6):
    if x == 3:
        break
    print(x)
else:
    print("Finally finished!")

```

**Output:**

```
0
1
2

```

The `else` block will NOT be executed if the loop is stopped by a `break` statement.

### **Nested Loops**

You can use loops within loops.

```python
adj = ["red", "big", "tasty"]
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

for x in adj:
    for y in fruits:
        print(x, y)

```

**Output:**

```
red apple
red banana
red cherry
big apple
big banana
big cherry
tasty apple
tasty banana
tasty cherry

```

### **One-Line For Loop**

```python
[x for x in range(5)]

```

---

## **2. Functions**

Functions allow you to organize your code into reusable blocks. Here's a basic function:

```python
def greet(name):
    print("Hello, " + name)

greet("Alice")  # Output: Hello, Alice

```

---

## 3. Functions in Python

### Defining Functions

A function in Python is defined using the `def` keyword. You can define a function to perform specific tasks and optionally return values.

Example:

```python
def greet(name):
    return "Hello, " + name

result = greet("Alice")
print(result)  # Output: Hello, Alice

```

### Function Parameters and Arguments

Functions can take parameters, which are values passed into the function when it is called. You can also specify default values for parameters.

Example:

```python
def greet(name, age=25):
    return f"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old."

print(greet("Alice"))  # Output: Hello, Alice! You are 25 years old.
print(greet("Bob", 30))  # Output: Hello, Bob! You are 30 years old.

```

### Return Statement

A function can return values to be used elsewhere in the program. If there is no `return` statement, the function returns `None` by default.

Example:

```python
def add(x, y):
    return x + y

result = add(5, 3)
print(result)  # Output: 8

```

### Function Scope

The scope of a variable refers to where it is accessible within the program. Variables defined inside a function are local to that function, and variables defined outside are global.

Example:

```python
x = "global"

def test_scope():
    x = "local"
    print("Inside function:", x)

test_scope()
print("Outside function:", x)

```

**Output**:

```
Inside function: local
Outside function: global

```

### **Built-in Functions**

- **`abs()`**: Returns the absolute value of a number.
- **`all()`**: Returns True if all elements in an iterable are true.
- **`any()`**: Returns True if any element in an iterable is true.
- **`bin()`**: Converts an integer to binary.

### Lambda Functions

Lambda functions are small anonymous functions that are defined using the `lambda` keyword. They are often used for simple operations that are used once or twice.

Example:

```python
multiply = lambda x, y: x * y
result = multiply(4, 5)
print(result)  # Output: 20

```

## 4. Modules and Packages

### Importing Modules

You can import external Python files (modules) to reuse their code in your program.

Example:

```python
import math
print(math.sqrt(16))  # Output: 4.0

```

### Aliasing Modules

You can use the `as` keyword to assign an alias to an imported module, which can make the code shorter and more readable.

Example:

```python
import math as m
print(m.pi)  # Output: 3.141592653589793

```

### From...Import Statement

You can import specific functions or variables from a module instead of importing the whole module.

Example:

```python
from math import sqrt
print(sqrt(25))  # Output: 5.0

```

### Creating Your Own Module

You can create your own module by saving your Python code in a `.py` file and importing it into other programs.

For example, create a file `mymodule.py` with the following content:

```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

```

Then, in another Python file, you can import and use the function:

```python
import mymodule
print(mymodule.greet("Alice"))  # Output: Hello, Alice!

```

## 5. Exception Handling

### Try, Except Block

Exception handling allows you to catch errors and handle them gracefully instead of allowing the program to crash.

Example:

```python
try:
    x = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by zero!")

```

**Output**:

```
Cannot divide by zero!

```

### Multiple Except Clauses

You can have multiple `except` clauses to handle different types of exceptions.

Example:

```python
try:
    x = int("hello")
except ValueError:
    print("Invalid value!")
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by zero!")

```

**Output**:

```
Invalid value!

```

### Finally Clause

The `finally` block will execute whether an exception occurs or not, making it useful for cleanup actions.

Example:

```python
try:
    file = open("file.txt", "r")
    # Read file content
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("File not found!")
finally:
    print("Execution finished.")

```

**Output**:

```
File not found!
Execution finished.

```

### Raising Exceptions

You can raise exceptions using the `raise` keyword, either for built-in exceptions or custom exceptions.

Example:

```python
def check_age(age):
    if age < 18:
        raise ValueError("Age must be 18 or older")
    else:
        print("Age is valid!")

try:
    check_age(16)
except ValueError as e:
    print(e)  # Output: Age must be 18 or older

```

## 6. Classes and Objects

### Defining a Class

A class is a blueprint for creating objects (instances). You define a class using the `class` keyword.

Example:

```python
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def bark(self):
        return f"{self.name} says woof!"

# Create an object (instance) of the class
dog = Dog("Buddy", 3)
print(dog.bark())  # Output: Buddy says woof!

```

### The `__init__` Method

The `__init__` method is the constructor used for initializing new objects. It is called when a new instance of the class is created.

Example:

```python
class Car:
    def __init__(self, make, model, year):
        self.make = make
        self.model = model
        self.year = year

    def display_info(self):
        return f"{self.year} {self.make} {self.model}"

car = Car("Toyota", "Corolla", 2022)
print(car.display_info())  # Output: 2022 Toyota Corolla

```

### Inheritance

Inheritance allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from another class.

Example:

```python
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def speak(self):
        return "Animal sound"

class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return f"{self.name} says woof!"

dog = Dog("Buddy")
print(dog.speak())  # Output: Buddy says woof!

```

### Method Overriding

You can override methods in a subclass to provide a different implementation.

Example:

```python
class Animal:
    def speak(self):
        return "Animal sound"

class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return "Woof!"

dog = Dog()
print(dog.speak())  # Output: Woof!

```

### Class and Instance Variables

- Class variables are shared by all instances of a class.
- Instance variables are unique to each instance of the class.

Example:

```python
class Cat:
    species = "Feline"  # Class variable

    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name  # Instance variable

cat1 = Cat("Whiskers")
cat2 = Cat("Tom")

print(cat1.name)     # Output: Whiskers
print(cat1.species)  # Output: Feline
print(cat2.name)     # Output: Tom
print(cat2.species)  # Output: Feline

```
